## Hello! I am Sachith.

I'm a self-taught programmer with a passion for building cool things with code.
I'm proficient in languages such as C++ and Python and I have a strong foundation in
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm always eager to learn and improve my skills,and I enjoy
participating in hackathons and coding challenges in my free time. If you have a project that
you think I might be able to contribute to, or if you just want to chat about web development, programming or tech, don't hesitate to reach out.
 I'm always happy to connect with others in the community.
